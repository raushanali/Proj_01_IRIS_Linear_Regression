# Proj_01_IRIS_Linear_Regression

This project is based on the Iris dataset, using only the first 50 samples of the Iris Setosa species.
It applies a Linear Regression model to predict Sepal Width based on Sepal Length.

Purpose
Goal: To understand and visualize the relationship between two features (Sepal Length and Sepal Width) using Linear Regression.

Main Features:
Load data from the Iris dataset
Train a Linear Regression model
Plot Actual vs Predicted values
Display model performance metrics (MSE and R2 score)

How to Use
Run the code in Python (make sure scikit-learn and matplotlib are installed).
The output will show the training MSE, R2 score, and a scatter plot comparing actual and predicted values.
